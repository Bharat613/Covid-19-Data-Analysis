COVID-19 in India Data Analysis using Tableau

This project provides a thorough analysis of COVID-19 in India using Tableau, encompassing various demographic, geographic, and health indicators to reveal trends and insights across the pandemic's progression. Leveraging multiple data points, this project showcases how age, gender, testing, and vaccination efforts impacted COVID-19 outcomes across regions.

Key Features:
Age Group & Gender Analysis: Visualizations that break down COVID-19 cases and outcomes by age and gender, helping to identify high-risk demographics and trends in disease severity.
State-wise Testing & ICMR Testing Data: Analysis of COVID-19 testing data, including ICMR and state-wise testing statistics. This feature tracks testing coverage, positive and negative sample counts, and regional testing intensity.
Doses Administered: Insights into vaccination efforts across India, showing the progression of doses administered over time and their impact on case trends.
Case Outcomes (Cured, Confirmed, Deaths): Visualization of cumulative and daily trends in confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths, providing a full picture of pandemic outcomes over time.
Interactive Dashboards for Dynamic Exploration: A suite of interactive dashboards where users can filter data by state, age group, gender, and time period to explore specific patterns and insights.
Sample Analysis: Examination of sample testing outcomes (positive, negative, total samples) to assess testing effectiveness and infection rates among tested individuals.
Objectives:
This project aims to offer a detailed view of the COVID-19 landscape in India, with actionable insights for healthcare officials, policymakers, and researchers. By integrating diverse data dimensions, the project not only tracks COVID-19 progression but also highlights the impact of testing and vaccination initiatives on various demographics across India.
